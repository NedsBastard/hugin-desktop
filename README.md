Hugin is a messaging service where messages are stored on the Kryptokrona Blockchain. Your messages are secured with industry leading encryption so that only you and your chat partner have the possibility to read them. **The purpose** is **not** to gather any personal information about the users, unlike most apps and social media.

Hugin also packs some powerful decentralized P2P encrypted features like **video, voice**, **screen sharing** and **filesharing**. This is possible because we've managed to compress the requests to establish a connection (called SDP) with WebRTC from over 2000 characters to less than 200 – which means that a connection through Hugin is possible!
